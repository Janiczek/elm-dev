# Elm Dev Binary for Windows (x64)

Some people install Elm Dev with `npm`. This package helps make [`npm install elm-dev`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm-dev) a bit faster and a bit more reliable. It is not intended for direct use!

If you do not need to use `npm`, the official binaries are published via [Lamdera](https://static.lamdera.com/bin/elm-dev/).
