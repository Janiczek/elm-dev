The contents of Ext.FileCached are vendored from Elm core with minor modifications

Running `vendor.sh` should cause a no-op, unless Elm core changes significantly in a future version, and in that scenario hopefully our modifications are relatively easy to setup again.

In any case â€“ this should be less pain than having directly modified the original files to support different modes and then trying to keep up.
